            I am driven by a passion for building full-fledged, impactful projects from the ground up.
            My primary focus is on developing Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) with the sole purpose of 
            delivering tangible benefits and solving real-world problems. This Doctor Appointment system 
            is a demonstration of that philosophyâ€”a clean, user-friendly interface built with modern 
            frontend technologies to simplify a common, everyday challenge.
